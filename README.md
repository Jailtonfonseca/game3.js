## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install required software

 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### 2. Fork the repository

* [![Fork Game3.js](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/alto-io/game3.js.svg?style=social&label=Fork%20Game3.js&maxAge=2592000)](https://GitHub.com/alto-io/game3.js/fork)

### 3. Run the app

From inside project directory:
* Install dependencies with `yarn`.
* Start game with `yarn start`.
* The game is available at http://localhost:3000.

## ðŸ•¹ Playing A Game

 ![New Room Button](images/newroom.png?raw=true "New Room Button")

 * Press The `+ New Room` button
 * Specify the parameters, then press the `Create` button

## ðŸ“¼ Watching A Replay

 ![Watch Replay](images/watchreplay.png?raw=true "Watch Replay")

 * Once a game session finishes, a replay is saved client-side via IPFS. To watch the video, press the `Watch` button

## Creating Your Own Game

Game3.js currently does not support more than one game yet, and requires you to fork the whole repo. Here are some general next steps for making a new game: 

  * Play around with the TOSIOS Example to understand how Colyseus and Pixi.js work. Most of the game-related code is in `packages/client` and `packages/common`. The vanilla [TOSIOS](https://github.com/halftheopposite/tosios) repo is also a great reference.
  * Future versions of Game3.js will integrate the Web 3 Login for player identity and the IPFS replays for smart contract leaderboards. For games to be more easily integrated, the following integration points should be done:
	  1. Once logged in, the game should use the saved player name
	  2. Once a game finishes, the game should successfully save a replay

## Using the Saved Player Name
* In [Home.tsx](packages/client/src/scenes/Home.tsx#L195), the player name is passed to the game via the [playerProfile prop](packages/client/src/scenes/Home.tsx#L46). The playerName is sent as a [query string to the /new endpoint](packages/client/src/scenes/Home.tsx#L205).
* For games that don't use Colyseus client-side, the same method can be used: a url endpoint leads to a new game, and query strings are passed to initialize variables.

## Saving A Replay
* Game3.js uses the [MediaRecorder Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) to save a replay of a game session on client-side IPFS.
* A [canvas object](packages/client/src/scenes/Game.tsx#L81-L84) which shows the game client is saved by the API
* Once a game starts [startRecording()](packages/client/src/scenes/Game.tsx#L304-L344) is called in Game.tsx
* Once the game is finished [stopRecording()](packages/client/src/scenes/Game.tsx#L346-L374) is called, which saves the stream onto a webm file stored in IPFS (see localSaveReplay()).
* For games that don't use Colyseus, the MediaRecorder API can be used directly to store a stream of the gameplay which can be the parameter for localSaveReplay().
